# README: Exceptions and Interrupts MCQ

## Overview
This document contains **20 multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** focused on **exceptions and interrupts** in computer architecture. The questions cover the fundamentals of exceptions, interrupt handling, their impact on pipelined processors, and the mechanisms used to manage them effectively.

## Topics Covered
The MCQs are categorized into the following sections:

1. **Exceptions and Interrupts**  
   - Definition and differences between exceptions and interrupts  
   - Examples of exceptions and interrupts  
   - Register usage in exception handling  

2. **Handling Exceptions**  
   - System actions upon encountering an exception  
   - The role of the Cause and EPC registers in MIPS  

3. **Vectored Interrupts**  
   - Mechanisms for addressing interrupt handlers  
   - Benefits of vectored interrupts  

4. **Exceptions in a Pipeline**  
   - The impact of exceptions on a pipelined CPU  
   - Steps required before handling an exception  

5. **Restartable Exceptions**  
   - Characteristics of restartable exceptions  
   - How the CPU resumes execution after handling exceptions  

6. **Multiple Exceptions**  
   - Handling scenarios where multiple exceptions occur simultaneously  
   - Challenges in maintaining precise exceptions  

7. **Imprecise Exceptions**  
   - Definition and challenges of imprecise exceptions  
   - Trade-offs between hardware simplicity and software complexity  

8. **Exception Handling Example**  
   - Practical examples of exception handling in MIPS  
   - Actions an exception handler can take  

## Purpose
These MCQs are designed to:
- Reinforce understanding of **exception handling mechanisms** in modern processors.
- Provide a structured way to **review key concepts** related to processor control flow.
- Assist students and professionals in **preparing for exams or interviews** on computer architecture.

## Usage
- Use this document to **self-test** your knowledge of exceptions and interrupts.
- Incorporate these questions into quizzes or **interactive learning sessions**.
- Discuss challenging questions with peers or instructors to **deepen understanding**.
